	<itunes:summary>Stacey Higginbotham has covered technology since 2001. In my years covering tech I became more fascinated by the stuff were were able to do on vast computing networks and ever speedier mobile and wireline broadband networks. Finally all of the elements of the technology I’ve covered in more than a decade have culminated in this moment and we’re creating the internet of things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No matter what you call it, we’re at a pivotal moment in the evolution of human creativity, business creation and productivity gains. We could see the gains we make in these next few years help us conserve resources and let us lead safer and healthier lives or we could open the door to a dystopian society where our every thought is monitored and our every utterance is effectively for sale. I hope to explore all of these issues, the people who will make it possible and the devices that will lead us there in the IoT Podcast. I hope you will join me.</itunes:summary>

<p>I was at the Smart Kitchen Summit this week, and ran into Tony Ciepiel, COO of Vitamix, which just launched a connected blender. I had a few moments to ask Ciepiel how Vitamix was thinking about bringing its blenders into the 21st century and why. He explained how to think about technology in a product designed to be an heirloom and what it means for the company&#8217;s operations to support a connected device. We also talk about sharing data across connected products and how technology changes blenders&#8217; capabilities. Enjoy the show!</p>

<li>Dell and Salesforce are adapting to the IoT</li>
<li>Cheaper LIDAR and smarter cars are coming</li>
<li>August locks are good but the doorbell made me angry</li>
<li>Why use Bluetooth as opposed to Wi-Fi in a connected blender</li>
<li>Software can let you count calories even more granularly</li>

I&#8217;m optimistic that consumers will get more innovation and better data. We also hit on a <a href="https://staceyoniot.com/meet-noon-a-stealth-lighting-startup-by-a-former-nest-executive/">stealthy new lighting startup</a> from a former Nest co-founder, a <a href="https://medium.com/self-driven/how-ford-and-lyft-are-teaming-up-to-take-self-driving-cars-mainstream-9bf2974a912a">partnership around autonomous vehicles</a> and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/26/16371292/google-youtube-amazon-echo-show">fight between Google and Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>My guest is Matt Rogers, co-founder and VP of Engineering at Nest, who discusses the rationale behind the new Nest Security system and where Nest is heading. We also talk about efforts to build a closer relationship between the Google Home and Nest teams. Plus, he offers hope for an eventual HomeKit integration, although I am not going to hold my breath. Enjoy the show.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow. This week saw some big news from <a href="https://staceyoniot.com/nest-debuts-nest-secure-home-system-and-has-a-thread-router-called-nest-connect/">Nest as it announced a new security system</a> plus other devices. August also <a href="https://www.cnet.com/products/august-smart-lock-2017/overview/">updated its line of locks</a> and promised a better doorbell. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16337854/amazon-alexa-glasses-security-camera-rumor">rumors</a> of an Amazon Alexa security system or even glasses emerged. And Google <a href="http://www.droid-life.com/2017/09/19/google-home-mini-exclusive/">leaked</a> some news. We also talked about <a href="https://www.silverspringnet.com/article/press-release/itron-acquire-silver-spring-networks-accelerate-smart-grid-smart-city-innovation-growth/">smart grid M&amp;A</a> and Comcast buying Stringify, a company that links together myriad devices and lets you create scenes. Kevin also shared his thoughts on the Apple Watch with LTE and we answer a reader question about garage doors.</p>

He discusses the existential threat that faced Hitachi and why it needed to make a move as well as shared how Hitachi is offering trains as a service. There&#8217;s a lot to digest in this show, but it&#8217;s a solid overview of the big news this week.</p>

<p>Our guest this week talks about a particularly relevant topic given the recent hurricanes. David Martin, co-founder and managing director of <a href="https://powerledger.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Power Ledger,</a> is building an energy trading market using blockchain, connected meters and a network of residential solar. He discusses the bifurcation of the energy market, the trend towards resiliency and how the blockchain can help generate revenue for consumers and the larger energy grid. But, as you&#8217;ll hear in this interview, it&#8217;s a disruptive concept.</p>

<li>Hey Apple, show me the HomeKit!</li>
<li>In which we shame Samsung on Blueborne missteps</li>
<li>What to do with an ancient security system? Rip it out.</li>
<li>How to use blockchain to make money on renewables</li>
<li>Building a more resilient grid starts with IoT (and the blockchain)</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grab your headset for a special bonus edition of the Internet of Things Podcast from the CEDIA show floor in San Diego. Last week I attended the show, which is aimed at the professional AV installer market to understand what&#8217;s hot, what&#8217;s not and how the business of home automation will evolve. I saw some beautiful televisions and more light switches than I even knew existed, while I walked away despairing of ever getting the smart home experience right.</p>

<p>I spoke with Julie Jacobson, the founding editor of <a href="http://www.cepro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEPro</a> to find out what she thought was cool, met with Tim McInery of <a href="http://www.savant.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Savant</a> to talk about the benefits consumer tech has on the installer business and asked Richard Gunther of the <a href="http://www.thedigitalmediazone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Media Zone</a> to explain the changes in business models. I also interviewed the CEO of <a href="https://www.josh.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Josh.ai</a> to understand why the smart home industry has progressed so slowly, and talked to Ragan Mena, the president of <a href="http://www.audiozeal.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audio Zeal</a>, a custom installer to see what toys he was excited about. He did like the Josh Micro, which enables voice access for older custom systems.</p>
<p>This entire episode was sponsored by <a href="https://ring.com/stacey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ring</a>, which is offering discounts on bundles of home security items to both consumers and pro installers.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GE is not giving up on its industrial IoT dreams, but it is <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1B80CB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scaling back a bit</a>. We discuss what that means before diving into an array of assistant news. Kevin and I give some tips for using the <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2297100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Echo&#8217;s multi-room audio feature</a> before discussing what the partnership between <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2017/08/30/hey-cortana-open-alexa-microsoft-amazons-first-kind-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon and Microsoft&#8217;s Cortana means</a>. We also download some news about <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/your-google-assistant-is-coming-to-new-speakers-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Assistant from IFA</a>, where we also learned of new <a href="https://www.elgato.com/eve/coming-soon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elgato sensors</a>. They are pretty.  Finally, Kevin built us all a present!</p>

<p>This week&#8217;s guest, Alasdair Allan, is a tinkerer and researcher who is thinking about the way we secure highly distributed systems. His concern is malicious data inserted into a system that can report false information to bring about a destructive action. In his example, someone created an imaginary moisture sensor that told a vineyard sprinkler system the ground was dry. It wasn&#8217;t. The resulting overwatering was a problem for the vines and resulted in a large fine. If you&#8217;re a blockchain fan, you&#8217;ll want to hear this one too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The breaking story as we recorded this show was <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/sonos-accept-new-privacy-policy-speakers-cease-to-function/">Sonos updating its Terms of Service</a> to prepare for the Amazon Echo integration. As part of this update, the connected speaker maker confirmed that customers who did not accede to the new terms of service would see their devices stop working in the future. This didn&#8217;t go over well, but this is a complicated issue. Kevin and I break many of <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/346984-uber-wins-court-ruling-allowing-it-to-keep-customers-from-suing-in-court">these issues</a> down.

<p>Our guest this week is Nick Dawson, executive director of the Johns Hopkins Sibley innovation hub. If you want to hear about applying some DIY tech to healthcare, Dawson has stories for you. He describes how his team built a separate network to experiment with Amazon Dash buttons, Amazon Echoes, Sonoses, Philips Hue lights and even using Slack as a way to track patient calls. He&#8217;s looking for feedback, so if you have ideas, want to talk security or even hospital IT, you can find him at <a href="https://www.debughealthcare.com">www.debughealthcare.com</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/nickdawson?lang=en">@nickdawson</a> on Twitter.</p>

<p>Our guest this week covers what we need to do to continue building out the internet of things. As SVP and General Manager of Silicon Labs&#8217; IoT division, Daniel Cooley has the unenviable task of predicting what features chips will need three to five years before he thinks we&#8217;ll need them. In this segment he talks about pushing more math to sensors, how important it is to get security right, the future of human-to-machine interfaces and the types of business models we&#8217;ll need. He also dives into the concept of unified data models for the internet of things&#8211; essentially defining in software what a physical product can do. You&#8217;ll learn a lot.</p>
